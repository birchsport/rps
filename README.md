This is the initial imply of a simple RPS game using the 'optimal algorithm'
strategy for winning the game.  I have tried to capture good/acceptable
Scala idioms/standards a much as possible, and documented as much as possible.
(With the obvious exception of having everything in one file.

The initial idea is to use it as a base for teaching students 
how to write a simple game like this from scratch.

To play, check this project out and import into IntelliJ.  There is no
sbt or grade for it yet.  Please feel free to add.

Also, please feel free to refactor, document, alter as you see fit,
jut keep in mind the goal.

Potential todos
Create some UI (i.e. web/Java2d)
Add support for multiple players
add support for additional pieces (i.e. Lizard and Spock)
